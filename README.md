## 📌 Project Overview

**DHA-Sync** is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline immigration and asylum case management for the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). It addresses critical challenges including:

- **Massive backlogs** (300,000+ unprocessed visa applications)
- **Outdated manual systems** (paper-based, fragmented processes)
- **Capacity constraints** (DHA operates with only 40% of required personnel)
- **Lack of transparency** (no track-and-trace for applicants)
- **Corruption vulnerabilities** (manual processes prone to exploitation)

> *"The Department of Home Affairs has struggled to process and deport illegal immigrants due to severe capacity constraints, outdated digital systems, and a massive backlog in asylum claims."*
